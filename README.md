# HKUEmoji

The category of our application is entertainment. We design a photo processing application which can help users make their own static emoticons and dynamic emoticons, and they can share the emoji to other peoples.
Our development target is iOS 9.0.

# How to Build it
Use Xcode to open HKUEmoji.xcodeproj directly. Make sure the target you want to build is HKUEmoji on iPhone 6, then just run it.
